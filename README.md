# ACNL-3DS-Sound-Extracting-and-Replacing
Hi! I am on a journey to extract all the music from ACNL to wav files and replace the music with city folk music! I wish to also compile either to .CIA or .3DS game files so they are playable! Any help is appreciated!
Please check releases for files!

Make sure you have WinRAR or 7zip to extract the files!
Also make sure you have Isabelle Sound Editor/Citric Composer to play the files!
